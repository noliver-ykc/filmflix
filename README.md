# Welcome
This a netflix type movie application built using react.js and redux kit. 
If you would like to fork this repository please run create react app. You will also need a .env file and a tmdb (the movie database) api key and account to fully use this on your own device. If instead you would just like to check out the project I have made, you can view it live here: (https://filmflix-noliver.netlify.app/).
